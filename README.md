- To use solythesis compiler, go to `solythesis` folder and read the `README.md` file. 

- To reproduce our experiments run 

`python3 ./run.py` and follows the instructions.

## Caveats

- The performance will be lower than the experiment results in paper since the experiments are performed in a virtual machine.

- If you cancel the experiments, make sure you kill all parity process before running other experiments.

- Don't run multiple experiments at the same time.
